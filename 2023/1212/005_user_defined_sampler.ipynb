        "\n",
        "A sampler has the responsibility to determine the parameter values to be evaluated in a trial.\n",
        "When a `suggest` API (e.g., :func:`~optuna.trial.Trial.suggest_float`) is called inside an objective function, the corresponding distribution object (e.g., :class:`~optuna.distributions.FloatDistribution`) is created internally. A sampler samples a parameter value from the distribution. The sampled value is returned to the caller of the `suggest` API and evaluated in the objective function.\n",
        "\n",
        "To create a new sampler, you need to define a class that inherits :class:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler`.\n",
        "The base class has three abstract methods;\n",
        ":meth:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler.infer_relative_search_space`,\n",
        ":meth:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler.sample_relative`, and\n",
        ":meth:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler.sample_independent`.\n",
        "\n",
        "As the method names imply, Optuna supports two types of sampling: one is **relative sampling** that can consider the correlation of the parameters in a trial, and the other is **independent sampling** that samples each parameter independently.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the beginning of a trial, :meth:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler.infer_relative_search_space` is called to provide the relative search space for the trial. Then, :meth:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler.sample_relative` is invoked to sample relative parameters from the search space. During the execution of the objective function, :meth:`~optuna.samplers.BaseSampler.sample_independent` is used to sample parameters that don't belong to the relative search space.\n",
